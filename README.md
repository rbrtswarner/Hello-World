# Hello-World
This is my first repository, will be used in the future as a portfolio.  I will be showing my progress through learning web and application development.

Hi there, My name is Robert
*/
(I am new to programming, or at least this advanced skill of programming.  I am fairly computer literate, and technically savvy.  The Technologies I learn as a hobby, I carry into my everyday life as a designer and inspector for small engineering firms in Texas. <br>  
  My inserests lay in/on advancing technology, math and technical writing, disaster investigation, (hurricane, flood, tornatos, etc., licensing and code compliance for structural engineering,... kind of a basic novice computer geek.<br>  
  That is why I am here, to advance into the next level of learning.  I have registered with microsoft and ms office as an insider (jump ahead level, constantly watching tutorial videos on Linked In. www.linkedin.com/in/robert-warner-aa5a70144.  I have a cheepie business webside at google too.  https://rswarner.business.site/<br>
  Wellper, enough for now. Hopefully I can become a contributer soon. Thanks for you time.)

  September 22, 2021...
  
   I have had enough of the decline of quality and craftsmanship in the residential construction industry.  The concern for safety (both for the contractors, and the consumers) is fairly non-existant also. I believe it is time for a career change...  I have decided to try my hand at web and application development fulltime.
   The lines I have comments out of this 'Hello World' file is before I found open-source.
   
   As such, no. I am not using a MS platform anymore. Linux has been and is now a good platform for me to work on.  Sites like @github, @mozilla,and @codecadrmy are now my favorite friends.
   
   I have decided to learn coding and programming so I can develop programs and websites dedicated to those, still in the residfential construction industry, that actually still do try to hold onto old values. Quality and craftsmanship. Build it right.... NOT 'right now', Where it really is not about the money, at is about the finished building. 
   
   So to all those who might stumble across this repository.... Welcome.... sit, browse, point and laugh... I dont mind.  I am in the beginning phases of the education of 'The "Coding" Carpenter's' Education. Feel free to contact me with and advice, comments, concerns, critques.  
   
   Have a great day.
